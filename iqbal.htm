            <h2>Motivation to study CSE</h2>
            <p style ="font-family:Bookman;font-size:20px;"> I've always been enthusiastic about the electric devices especially Computers.</br>
			Since I'd had my first computer on grade 9, I finally got to use it in first hand and was amazed to see how many things I can do using a computer.</br>
			I've always loved math. And it's wonderful how easily I can solve mathematical problems using computer coding. </br>
			I want to use my problem solving knowledge in the field of computer and eventually to make a difference in the world.</p>
